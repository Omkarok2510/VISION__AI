## Live Dashboard Updates
All dashboard data (map, stats, tables) refreshes automatically every 5 seconds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
**Backend:** Python 3, Flask, SQLite3, requests, hashlib, math

**Telegram Bot:** python-telegram-bot library, OpenCV (cv2), numpy, Pillow (PIL)

**Frontend (Dashboard):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js (for maps), Jinja2 (templating in Flask)

**Deployment/Tunneling:** Ngrok (for exposing local Flask server to Telegram)

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- pip (Python package installer)
- Ngrok account and authenticated Ngrok client
- A Telegram Bot Token (obtainable from BotFather on Telegram)

### 1. Clone the Project
Although not a git repository yet, create a dedicated folder and place all your project files (`app.py`, `telegram_bot.py`, `templates/dashboard.html`, `media/`) inside it.

```bash
# Create your project directory
mkdir haier_complaint_system
cd haier_complaint_system
# Place your app.py, telegram_bot.py, and templates/dashboard.html here
# Create a 'media' folder for bot uploads:
mkdir media
# Create a 'templates' folder for your HTML:
mkdir templates
# Move dashboard.html into the templates folder
mv dashboard.html templates/
```
### 2. Set up Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```
bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:
```
bash
pip install Flask Flask-Cors python-telegram-bot requests opencv-python numpy Pillow
```
###4. Obtain Telegram Bot Token
Open Telegram and search for @BotFather

Start a chat with BotFather and send /newbot

Follow the instructions to choose a name and a username for your bot

BotFather will give you an HTTP API Token - copy this token

### 5. Configure telegram_bot.py
Open telegram_bot.py and modify the following lines:

python
!!! IMPORTANT: REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL BOT TOKEN !!!
TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" 

!!! IMPORTANT: UPDATE THIS WITH YOUR CURRENT NGROK FORWARDING URL !!!
You MUST get a new URL from ngrok each time you restart it
FLASK_SERVER_URL = "https://your-ngrok-url-here.ngrok-free.app/submit_complaint"
Replace "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with your actual Telegram Bot Token

The FLASK_SERVER_URL will change every time you restart Ngrok (unless you have a paid Ngrok plan)

### 6. Delete Old Database (CRITICAL!)
To ensure the database schema is up-to-date (especially for technician locations and complaint assignment fields), you MUST delete the existing database file before starting the Flask app.

Navigate to your project directory (haier_complaint_system) and delete any existing database.db file.

### 7. Start Ngrok Tunnel
Run the following command to expose your local Flask server:
```
bash
ngrok http 5000
Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (it will look like https://<RANDOM_ID>.ngrok-free.app) and update the FLASK_SERVER_URL in telegram_bot.py.
```
### 8. Run the Flask Application
In a separate terminal (with your virtual environment activated), run:
```
bash
python app.py

```
### 9. Start the Telegram Bot
In another terminal (with virtual environment activated), run:
```
bash
python telegram_bot.py
Progress Tracking
Users can track their complaint status via the bot or a separate web page.
